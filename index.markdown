## About Me
🤗 Howdy! My name is Yufeng Yang (杨钰峰 ,pronounced as u-feng iang). I'm a Ph.D. student at CSE department, **Texas A&M University**, advised by Prof.Yi Zhou. My general research interests revolve around the foundations of machine learning.  I'm particularly interested in 

> **stochastic optimization**: Algorithm design and convergence analysis for modern machine learning paradigms. 

> **Mathematics of Deep Learning**: Statistical quantification for the mechanism of certain network architecture; Network training dynamics and optimization algorithm analysis. 

> **Reinforcement learning theory**, including distributional RL, multi-agent RL and RL reasoning for LLMs. 
Beyond my research career, I love watching soccer games, listening to Rap and Afro music, and watching horror movies. I'm also a big fan of trains and aviation.
