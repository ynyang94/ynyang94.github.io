## About Me
Howdy! My name is Yufeng Yang (杨钰峰 ,pronounced as u-feng iang). I'm a third year PhD student at CSE department, **Texas A&M University**, advised by [Prof. Yi Zhou](https://sites.google.com/site/yizhouhomepage/home). I leverage **foundational ML principles** to address the computational and algorithmic challenges arising from **large-scale machine learning**. My current and prospective research focuses on:

> **Distributionally Robust Optimization for ML**: Since the beginning of my Ph.D., my research has been driven by the challenges of distribution shifts in large-scale datasets. Specifically, I focus on ML training paradigms subject to distributional drift, utilizing optimization theory to convert loss formulations under uncertainty into tractable, solvable problems. I am particularly interested in bridging this framework to training scenarios such as **adversarial training, multi-task learning, Reinforcement Learning and LLM pre/post-training**.

> **Efficient first/zeroth-order Optimization Algorithm**: Modern modeling techniques—including sequential modeling (RNN and SSM variants), multi-modal learning, and on-policy RL often result in ill-conditioned geometric loss landscapes and heavy-tailed representation distributions. My research focuses on designing efficient **first and zeroth-order optimization** algorithms for these complex formulations, including **bi-level, compositional, and contextual dependent objectives**. I am dedicated to exploring relationship between *problem-dependent parameters, algorithmic structures (such as **learning rate scheduling, normalization/clipping, variance reduction, momentum/extrapolation, pre-conditioning etc**) and the resulting convergence performance*.

Furthermore, I am interested in emerging topics such as system-aware optimization and RL algorithms tailored for large-scale GPU clusters. **My goal is to bridge foundational theory with AI infrastructure to maximize system-level performance**, alongside exploring the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.
