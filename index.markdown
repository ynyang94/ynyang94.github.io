## About Me
🤗 My name is Yufeng Yang (杨钰峰 ,pronounced as u-feng iang). I'm a Ph.D. student at CSE department, **Texas A&M University**, advised by [Prof. Yi Zhou](https://sites.google.com/site/yizhouhomepage/home). My general research interests revolve around the **foundations of machine learning**.  Specially, I'm interested in the following fields:

> **Stochastic Optimization**: Algorithm design and convergence analysis for modern machine learning paradigms. 

> **Mathematics of Deep Learning**: Statistical quantification for the mechanism of certain network architecture; Network training dynamics and optimization algorithm analysis. 

> **Reinforcement Learning Theory**, including distributional RL, multi-agent RL and RL reasoning for LLMs.
